- 👋 Hi, I’m @ykvdd
- 👀 I’m interested in Development/Engineering in general, love creating and breking things since I was little.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying machine learning.
- ❤️ Space, space is, and will be my biggest love till it's time ends. 
- 💩 Hate spaghetti code, but if it works, you can always refactor it.
- 🌐 From Italy, with spaghetti and love.
